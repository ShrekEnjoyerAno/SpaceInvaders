## Game Classes and Methods

### Sprite Class

The `Sprite` class is the base class for all moving objects in the game. It contains common properties and methods.

**Properties:**
- `x`, `y`: Position of the sprite.
- `width`, `height`: Dimensions of the sprite.
- `image`: Image representing the sprite.
- `destroyed`: Boolean indicating if the sprite is destroyed.

**Methods:**
- `draw(Graphics2D g)`: Draws the sprite on the screen.
- `getBounds()`: Returns a rectangle bounding the sprite.
- `checkCollision(int shotX, int shotY, int tileSize)`: Checks if the sprite collides with a shot.

### Player Class

The `Player` class represents the player's character. It extends the `Sprite` class and adds specific properties and methods.

**Properties:**
- `lives`: Number of lives the player has.
- `playerSpeed`: Speed of the player's movement.

**Methods:**
- `moveLeft(int speed)`: Moves the player to the left.
- `moveRight(int speed, int maxWidth, int tileSize)`: Moves the player to the right.
- `playerMoving(KeyHandler keyHandler, int panelWidth, int tileSize, int speed)`: Moves the player based on keyboard input.

### Alien Class

The `Alien` class represents an alien enemy. It extends the `Sprite` class and adds specific properties and methods.

**Properties:**
- `speed`: Speed of the alien's movement.

**Methods:**
- `move(CopyOnWriteArrayList<Alien> aliens, int panelWidth)`: Moves all aliens and checks for direction change.
- `update(Shot shot, int tileSize)`: Updates the alien's state based on collisions with shots.
- `shoot()`: Creates and returns a new `AlienShot`.
- `checkCollision(int shotX, int shotY, int tileSize)`: Checks for collisions with player shots.

### Shot Class

The `Shot` class represents a shot fired by the player.

**Properties:**
- `x`, `y`: Position of the shot.
- `isShooting`: Boolean indicating if the shot is currently active.

**Methods:**
- `draw(Graphics2D g, int width, int height)`: Draws the shot on the screen.
- `shooting(KeyHandler keyHandler, Player player, int shotSpeed)`: Updates the shot's position based on player input.

### AlienShot Class

The `AlienShot` class represents a shot fired by an alien. It extends the `Shot` class and adds specific methods.

**Methods:**
- `move(int shotSpeed)`: Moves the shot down the screen.
